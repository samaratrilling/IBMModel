Part1: how to run your code step by step (make sure your code can run on CLIC). 
Part2: performance for your algorithm (including precision, recall, and F-score). 
Part3: observations and comments about your experimental results. 
Part4: any additional information that is requested in the problem.

TO RUN ALL PARTS OF THE PROGRAM:
RUN run.bash
Total runtime: 

-------------------------------------------------
Q4
RUN q4.bash.
Runtime: 1.5 minutes.

Observations and comments:
Most of the top 10 translations seem to be spot on
according to a Google Translate with German. Individual
words that have a high level of ambiguity were more likely
to be incorrectly translated.

There were 15 sentences with different alignments between IBM1 model
and the IBM2 model. Those differences occurred for the following sentences:

3 differences

The differences here make sense - the differences tend to be on longer
sentences, where deeper understanding of the likelihood for certain alignment
order (the q parameters) have more of a chance to make an impact on the final
alignment.

The sentence beginning "mr president , it concerns the speech" had the most differences
between alignments, with 11 differences.

Overall, the number of differences tended to correspond to the length of the sentence.

Accuracy:
Right	Total	Acc
32		100		0.320
The IBM model in general is known not to be a perfect model for translation, and so the
accuracy here is fairly low.
There were many cases of an English sentence being aligned more than once.
There could be a number of optimizations for the last section (finding the proper alignments)
like taking sentences out of the pile of potential matches once they have already been matched,
but using the raw IBM 2 data does not seem to be especially worthwhile.
